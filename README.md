## Creative Coding 2: Custom Pixel

The images above are photos of Wellington CBD algorithmically processed with a lightly modified version of the [p5.js Pointillism example](https://p5js.org/examples/image-pointillism.html). The masks for each photo highlight various objects. Replace this text with your own which explains the source of your photos, masking, and applied algorithm.

My project started as  a love letter to Star Trek Online and used it's various ships and planets as trainning data for the masking algorithims. To this end I took screenshots of the game and created a series of masks by hand and left one image unaltered. Creating a new Mask via the Synmatic Filter system. This covered week 1-2. Week 1 was getting plenty of images to use for mask generation and training of the algorithim.  While mostly successful it mostly blended together masses of objects into a blob. 

During the end of week 2 I decided to try and use other images that weren't STO related and instead stuff like cars and trees to see if it detects those as well. I also decided to make use of a Star Trek the Origional Series effect of disintergration combined with blur. This will be a rainbow or neon outline with an internal blur similar to the 1960s/70s effect. 

Now in week 3-4 I am organising the coding portion of the project and my final wee sections and experiements. My plan is to apply my own filter, where the lines are around the edges while the insides are blured.
